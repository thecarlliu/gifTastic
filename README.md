# gifTastic

This assignment required me to create a website implementing the use of the Giphy API's search engine.\
The user is able to click on a button to generate a list of gifs that correspond with the cartoon from each button label.\
The user is also able to type into the text-input-field and press a button to add another button with the same functionality as the others.
